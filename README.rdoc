An extraordinarily simple app.

This app is (originally) intended to help out devs and QA for the Cambridge Systematics OneClick projects.
Bug Tracking/Project Management is occurring via Pivotal Tracker, where we are relying on labels to communicate between groups.

In order to support this workflow, we will set PT to POST activity to this webapp (hosted on heroku or other solution), which 
will parse the activity and update stories in PT accordingly, via the PT API.
